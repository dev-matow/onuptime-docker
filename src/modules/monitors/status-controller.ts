 * computed `becameDown` / `becameUp` transition booleans and every
 * consequence hung off those edges. That works only if you observe
 * every transition — and with backfill, replay, a restarted worker, a
 * missed tick or (later) an edge node reconnecting with three days of
 * observations, you will not. An edge-triggered system fails *silently*
 * when it misses one, which is the only failure a monitoring product
 * may not have.
 *
 * So: no transitions. `deriveStatus` asks "what is true now", and
 * `reconcile` asks "what should be true, and what do I do about the
 * difference". Both are pure and both are safe to run repeatedly, at
 * any time, having missed anything.
