#
# ── the exit codes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Four outcomes, four numbers, because a script that wraps vigilctl has
# to be able to tell them apart and "did it print the word success" is
# not a contract. They are the same four for every subcommand:
#
#   0   success  — the command did the thing it names
#   10  no-op    — the system was already in the requested state and
#                  nothing was changed
#   20  refused  — a precondition said no. NOTHING was changed, and the
#                  reason is one line an operator can act on
#   1   failure  — it tried and did not finish. State is described in
#                  the output, and where it is not, the command says so
#   2   usage    — the arguments were wrong
#
# The distinction between 20 and 1 is the one that matters at 3am: a
# refusal is safe to ignore or override, a failure is not.

# ── redaction ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# vigilctl prints configuration on nearly every run, and a doctor report
# is the thing an operator pastes into a support thread. So no secret is
# ever printed, not once, not truncated to a prefix: a prefix of a
# 32-byte key is still key material, and the length is all a diagnosis
# needs. What the operator learns is whether the value is set and
# whether it is long enough, which is exactly what goes wrong.

#
# Destructive commands need a human to say so. `--yes` is that human
# having said so in advance, which is how these run from a maintenance
# script; without it the operator types the word, and without a terminal
# to type into the command refuses rather than guessing.
#
# Refusing on a pipe is deliberate. The alternative is a command that
# reads EOF, treats it as consent and drops a database in a CI job that
# meant to ask a question.
