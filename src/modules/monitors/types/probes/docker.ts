 * as happily as over TCP — which is all dockerode would be doing here,
 * for a few megabytes and a native-ish install step in an image that
 * deliberately carries neither.
 *
 * The path is unversioned on purpose. Pinning `/v1.41/` would 400
 * against any daemon older than that, and the two fields this reads have
 * been in the response since the API was called v1.
