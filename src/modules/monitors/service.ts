/**
 * "This monitor is LATE", which is a different question from "this
 * monitor is owed a probe".
 *
 * The difference is the claim, and getting it wrong made every
 * measurement of scheduler health useless. A monitor a tick has claimed
 * is not selectable - that is the point of claiming - but it is still
 * late, because nothing has probed it yet. Measuring lateness with the
 * selection predicate therefore made a backlog vanish the instant a tick
 * looked at it, so a fleet the workers could not keep up with reported a
 * lag of at most one lease however far behind it really was.
 *
 * No grace period either. `TICK_GRACE_SECONDS` exists so a monitor due
 * at :02:02 is not missed by the :02:00 tick; it has nothing to do with
 * whether that monitor is late, and subtracting it here would report
 * every fleet as thirty seconds less behind than it is.
 *
 * High-frequency monitors are excluded, and the reason originally given
 * here was false. It said that plane "never writes
 * `next_evaluation_at`", so their due time is frozen and they would
 * report as permanently late. It does write it:
 * `HighFrequencyPlane.promote` calls `applyOutcome`, which is the same
 * `recordCheckOutcome` every other check goes through.
 *
 * The true reason is narrower. `promote` fires only when a sample says
 * something new, so the column advances on that plane's terms rather
 * than on the ordinary cadence, and measuring lateness against it would
 * report a number about a plane this predicate is not measuring.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP, stated rather than hidden: the exclusion is on the FLAG,
 * and the flag is not the same question as "is that plane actually
 * probing this monitor". A tenant whose high-frequency workers are all
 * dead has its monitors scheduled by the ordinary tick, where they can
 * fall arbitrarily behind, and this predicate still reports a backlog
 * of zero for them. Closing it needs the live-lease test, and that
 * lives in JavaScript (`shardOf` is an FNV hash, not a SQL function),
 * so it is a change to how this is computed rather than to the
 * predicate. `modules/monitors/highfreq/stats.ts` answers that plane's
 * own health in the meantime.

 * separation is the point — the old `WHERE last_checked_at + interval
 * <= now()` meant the selection query *was* the scheduling policy, so
 * changing the policy meant rewriting the scheduler.
 *
 * Most-overdue first WITHIN a tenant, and then the best-ranked monitor
 * of each tenant first. Plain most-overdue-first across the whole
 * installation is starvation-free for a monitor and starvation BY
 * CONSTRUCTION for a tenant: one organization with five thousand
 * monitors owns the head of the ordering for as long as it is behind,
 * and the tenant next to it with five monitors waits behind all of them
 * however small it is. This is the same shape, and the same fix, as
 * `notification_outbox`'s fair drain - see `dueRankingSql`.
 *
 * The rank is computed in one statement and the rows are fetched by id
 * in a second. Two statements rather than one because the relational
 * query builder cannot express a window function, and a single hand-
 * written statement returning whole rows would have to name and map
 * every column of the widest table in the product.
 *
 * The kind filter is the other half of "a group is never scheduled".
 * A group has nothing to measure and a manual monitor has nothing to
 * ask, so selecting either would spend a queue slot and a worker to
 * write an observation identical to the last one. Stated as "not one of
 * these" rather than "one of the scheduled ones" on purpose: a monitor
 * whose type this build no longer has must keep being evaluated, and
 * keep reporting that it cannot be, instead of quietly falling off the
 * scheduler and looking healthy.

 * How long a monitor is taken off the due list by being enqueued.
 *
 * THE HOLE THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE. Not a race — `stately` genuinely
 * permits only one ACTIVE job per monitor, so no monitor is ever probed
 * twice at once — but a re-enqueue: the policy allows one queued job
 * beside the active one, so a tick firing while a monitor's check is
 * still running can add another, and the second runs the moment the
 * first finishes.
 *
 * Stated as a hole and not as a bug count, because the two counts this
 * comment used to carry were both wrong. Fifty-nine came from a
 * benchmark whose duplicate threshold was half an interval, which counts
 * the adaptive scheduler legitimately tightening on a monitor that
 * failed; eight replaced it and came from a dirty tree with workers
 * leaked from an earlier run probing the same monitors. Measured on
 * clean trees the figure is zero, in every cell of both builds.
 *
 * Selection was level-triggered on `next_evaluation_at` and enqueueing
 * changed nothing about it, so the tick had no way to know it had
 * already asked. Claiming closes that: the monitor leaves the SELECTABLE
 * set when it is enqueued and comes back when the check lands or the
 * lease runs out.
 *
 * In its own column, not by moving the due time. Moving it worked and
 * was wrong: `next_evaluation_at` stopped meaning "when this is next
 * due", and every reading of how far behind the scheduler is takes its
 * lateness from that column - so claiming a backlog HID it, and a fleet
 * the workers could not keep up with reported a lag of at most one lease
 * forever.
 *
 * The value has to exceed how long a job may sit before it runs, or a
 * busy queue re-enqueues anyway; it has to be finite, or a job that is
 * dropped takes its monitor with it forever.
 *
 * Ninety seconds is the ACTIVE bound plus slack, not the total: pg-boss
 * expires a `monitor-check` after 60 seconds of running and does not
 * retry it, so no single attempt outlives the lease. What can outlive it
 * is queue WAIT on a fleet that is already behind - and there the lease
 * expiring is the correct behaviour rather than a bug, because a monitor
 * whose job has been waiting longer than a lease is one the queue may
 * never get to. The duplicate that produces is bounded by the queue's
 * own unique index, which permits one waiting and one running check per
 * monitor and drops the rest.

 * means the second tick does not wait for the first and does not see its
 * rows: the two get disjoint sets, and neither has to know the other
 * exists. The `next_evaluation_at` re-check inside the UPDATE is the
 * other half — a monitor whose check completed between the snapshot and
 * the lock is no longer due, and pushing it forward would delay a
 * monitor that had just been probed.

 * debuggable failure this scheduler could produce.

 * A thousand is well under the ceiling and also bounds how many row
 * locks one statement holds at once. Each chunk is independently atomic,
 * so the two-ticks-take-disjoint-sets property is unchanged: `skip
