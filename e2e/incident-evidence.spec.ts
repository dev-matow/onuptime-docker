/**
 * A controlled failure, all the way to the screen.
 *
 * The integration suite proves the snapshot is stored and proves what is
 * in it. This proves the other half, which no unit test can: that an
 * operator opening the incident in a real browser is shown the thing
 * that was stored, and that it reads as an answer rather than as a dump.
 *
 * The failure is induced through `applyOutcome` - the same function the
 * worker, the probe settle loop and the "check it now" button call - so
 * what is on the screen got there the way a real outage would put it
 * there. Only the four diagnostic sockets are injected, because a test
 * that resolves real hostnames fails on somebody else's DNS.
