# `vigilctl backup` — take a dump through the path that already exists.
#
# The whole command is `scripts/backup.sh --docker` plus the two things
# an operator would otherwise have to remember: run it from the
# repository, and check that the archive holds anything. That script
# already writes to a `.partial` name, lists the archive before renaming
# it and warns when the database was empty, which is the safe backup
# path this is required to use rather than replace.
