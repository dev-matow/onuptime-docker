# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time. This is a small project maintained by one
person, so a little structure keeps it workable.

## Before you build something big

**Open an issue first** for anything beyond a bug fix. Not to gatekeep —
to save you the wasted evening. Some things are deliberately out of
scope for Core (see "Scope" below), and it's better to hear that before
you write the code than after.

Bug fixes, documentation fixes, and test additions need no preamble —
send the pull request.

## Development setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # DATABASE_URL + BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev                   # app
npm run worker:dev            # background checks
```

Tests need a separate database — point `TEST_DATABASE_URL` at one; the
suite migrates it itself:

```bash
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/vigil_core_test npm test
```

Before you open a pull request:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run format:check
```

CI runs the same three plus a Playwright end-to-end pass and a Docker
build. See [docs/HANDBOOK.md](docs/HANDBOOK.md) for the full command
table and debugging notes.

## Conventions worth knowing

These aren't style preferences — breaking them breaks things:

- **Services take `(db, actor, input)`.** `actor` is
  `{ organizationId, userId }`; every query is scoped by
  `organizationId`. That signature is what keeps tenants isolated.
- **The check loop owns monitor state.** `runMonitorCheck` is the only
  thing that advances a monitor's status or auto-resolves its incident.
- **Resolved incidents are terminal.** No transitions out of `resolved`.
- **Webhook signatures cover the exact body sent** — if you change how a
  body is built, the signature must be computed over the final bytes.
- **Migrations are append-only.** Change the schema in
  `src/db/schema/`, run `npm run db:generate`, commit the generated SQL.
  Never edit a migration that has shipped.
- **Timeline events marked `internal` (and `system` events) never reach
  the public status page.** If you add a new event type, decide which
  side of that line it sits on, and add a test.

## Tests

New behaviour needs a test. The suite is split:

- `tests/unit/` — pure functions, no database.
- `tests/integration/` — real Postgres, one throwaway organization per
  test (`createTestOrg`), so tests run in parallel safely.
- `e2e/` — Playwright, the golden path through the running app.

## Scope

Core aims to be a complete, honest uptime monitor for one team: forty
check types, incidents, status pages, email and webhook alerts. Things
that make it a bigger product — multi-tenancy, automatic recovery,
on-call rotation, paging over SMS — live in the commercial edition and
won't be merged here. That boundary is stated plainly in the README so
nobody is surprised by it.

Everything inside that scope is fair game, and the limitations list in
the README is a decent place to look for something worth doing —
**more notification providers** especially.

## Licensing your contribution

This project is Apache-2.0. Under section 5 of that licence, anything
you deliberately submit for inclusion is contributed under the same
terms unless you say otherwise — so **there is no CLA to sign and no
copyright to assign.**

Being plain about the consequence: Apache-2.0 permits the maintainer to
include your contribution in the commercial edition, which is sold. You
keep your copyright, your name stays on the commit, and you can use
your own work anywhere. If that trade is not one you want to make, say
so in the issue — a bug report with a clear reproduction is genuinely
valuable on its own and costs you nothing.

## Code of conduct

Be decent. Assume good faith, keep criticism about the code, and don't
make people regret showing up. Behaviour that makes this an unpleasant
place gets you removed from it.
