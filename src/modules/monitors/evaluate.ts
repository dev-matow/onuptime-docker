/**
 * One monitor, one observation — whatever kind it is.
 *
 * Four ways of coming to know something, one shape of answer. The
 * caller does not learn which happened: it gets a {@link CheckResult}
 * exactly like the one a probe produces, judged by the same engine
 * against the same declared assertions, and everything downstream —
 * the status controller, incidents, uptime, the ledger — carries on
 * unable to tell a dialled monitor from a derived one.
 *
 * That indistinguishability is the deliverable. The alternative, and
 * the shape this replaced in every product that has grown a group type
 * late, is a second pipeline: groups with their own status field, their
 * own incident rules and their own uptime that quietly means something
 * else. Two pipelines is how a status page ends up green because the
 * group's copy of the state was never updated.
